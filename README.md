# Linear_regression
Implementation of Linear Regression with preprocessing, visualization, and model evaluation using Python.
This project demonstrates the implementation of Linear Regression, one of the most basic fundamental supervised machine learning algorithms used for predicting continuous values. 
The model establishes a relationship between independent variables (features) and a dependent variable (target) using a best-fit line.

#Objective
Understand how Linear Regression works.
Train a model using real data.
Predict continuous values.
Evaluate model performance using metrics.
